The project topic “Porto Seguro’s safe driver prediction” an online competition, is chosen from Kaggle.com. In this project, we are building a model that predicts the probability of a driver initiating an insurance claim in the coming year. An accurate prediction will allow Porto Seguro, one of Brazil’s largest auto and homeowner insurance companies and the sponsor of this competition, to further tailor their prices and to make auto insurance coverage more accessible to more drivers.
In this competition, we are given train and test data in the files train.csv and test.csv respectively. A row in the train.csv file corresponds to a policyholder and the target column specifies whether a claim was filed. A total of 57 features and 595,212 instances are specified
